##  Technical Highlight: GitHub-Based Digital CV

This project transformed a traditional Europass CV into a Markdown-based GitHub profile that’s readable, clean, and professional. I used Markdown to organize information for clarity.

**Key tools and skills used:**
- Markdown for digital documentation  
- Git for managing changes to the repository and synchronizing it with GitHub  
- VS Code for editing the `README.md`  
- GitHub for forking the CV repository, portfolio hosting, and professional presentation
